    <h1>Litzy's Portfolio ⋆˚꩜｡</h1>
    <img src="images/headshot.jpg" width="500px">
    <p>I am an aspiring UX engineer, interested in designing healthcare software, video game interface, and graphic design. My interest in these areas connect to the belief that technology should feel easy to use and accessible to everyone. I am especially motivated to design healthcare applications that bridge the gap in digital literacy, because no patient should feel like they cannot access their medical records or seek care. I imagine my work to help those who may have little to no experience with using technology or navigating digital platforms. My goal is to design tools that present medical information clearly to providers and understandable to patients. As a third-year student at Hunter College, double majoring in Human-Computing Interaction and Data Science, I am learning how to combine design and conducting research in user experience to create prototypes to test and analyze trends that could benefit healthcare applications.
I use programs like Figma and Framer, along with coding environments such as Visual Studio code to bring my ideas to life.
</p>
    <p>Outside of healthcare, I enjoy exploring creative design, such as experimenting with pixel art in video games or websites and 3D modeling. My influences go back to childhood, when I spent hours using PicsArt to create collages and thumbnails for my YouTube channel, experimenting with Videostar to add overlays and transitions to videos, and designing virtual homes in Roblox Studio. Today, I continue to expand my skills with tools like Final Cut Pro to edit videos, Lightroom for photography, and Ibis Paint for digital art. Honorable influential mentions are Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 8, and Dark Souls games.</p>
