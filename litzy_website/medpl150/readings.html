    <h1>Reflection on Susan Sontag’s On Photography</h1>

    <p>Photography to me, is the art of noticing. The composition of objects combined or isolated, capturing the beauty of nature around us is what I aim for when I take photographs. Every photograph has a different message and can further be enhanced with editing. Throughout history, photography is incredibly important and valuable to depict a time period—a place we cannot physically go back to but we can view the actions or experiences of others, art before its destruction, and those who aren’t among us anymore. An example would be: photographs of civil right movements, wars, and historical figures and their work. Many images aren’t just for mere aesthetics but to capture the truth, for advocacy, and exposing corruption.
This is also why it’s important how images are altered by editing. Today, we have more editing software and even artificial intelligence to recreate images.

    <h1>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster
     Nesrine Malik</h1>

    <p>
      This article written by Nesrine Malik discusses how AI has infiltrated into main stream media, social media, and how it’s becoming a destructive tool that is pushing “traditional” propaganda. Malik explains how users can now make AI-generated videos or images to harmfully influence, defame, and manipulate others. AI evolution to now being able to learn how to fabricate media through advanced analysis (stealing) our content, art, music, and all forms of media blurs the distinction between what’s real and not. Malik explains how pre-existing data “…is inherently biased against diversity, progressive gender roles and sexual orientations…” (Malik, The Guardian), which means the content that is generated is more inclined to regurgating harmful rhetoric. Deepfakes have become a whole other level, where people can make videos and images of others without their consent. People that often speak against marginalized communities can now create posts to share among others with similar agendas to attempt to devalue communities by make low-effort, hatred filled media to tarnish the severatity of a situation or someones identity. In this article, there’s three videos presented where the POTUS is idolized in a AI generated video. Additionally, a AI generated video of Elon Musk on pool chairs with the POTUS. Actively, someone is “seeing” a portray of him ‘relaxed’ and ‘calm’ next to Musk or putting the POTUS in a victorious deluded scenario where he takes over Gaza. Although it’s all fabricated and not real events—it still creates a false narrative of their character and covers up the reality of his identity and motives.

      Additionally, the most damaging part of it all is the lack of control and flagging of AI content. Individuals should know what sources are verified in order to distinct real events and fake ones. Our media outlets are coming more apathetic or fear mongering, less authenticity, and damaging.
      Malik discusses how a lot of this AI content is starting to flood our overall consumption of media and how that is straying away the public in being informed of the issues arising in our country. It’s a distraction.
